# Password Generator Project
The goal of this project is to create a strong password that provides greater security, for this reason it was necessary to accomplish some conditions:

* Password length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.
* Character types to include in the password:
    * lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.
* Input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected.

Also was considered to enter only numbers in the length of the password.

After the conditions above are accomplished a password is generated and it is displayed in the page.
